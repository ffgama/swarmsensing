PROJECT: SWARM SENSING - ANOMALY DETECTION BASED ON RECORDS BEES ACTIVITIES.

Description: Anomaly detection using traditional techniques such as KNN (distance measure) and LOF (density measure) based on records bees activities.

Source data: sensors RFID implanted on bees.
Some Features: climates variables (eg. temperature, pressure, solar radiation). 

Project: Master's thesis and support from Vale Institute Technology (ITV-DS).

Part 1: Unsupervised Learning: KNN + LOF  (R programming) 

Part 2: Supervised Learning: Neural Networks + Random Forest + SVM (Weka)
